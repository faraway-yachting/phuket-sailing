  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "bestTime": {
      "question": "What is the best time of year for sailing in Phuket?",
      "answer": "November to April offers the calmest seas and most reliable weather — this is peak season for Phuket sailing. Low season (May–October) brings 30–40% lower prices and quieter anchorages. Phuket sailing works year-round with the right route. We'll always recommend the best itinerary for your exact travel dates."
    },
    "catamaranVsSailing": {
      "question": "Is a catamaran better than a sailing yacht in Phuket?",
      "answer": "Catamarans offer more space and stability — ideal for families and larger groups. Sailing yachts deliver a more authentic sailing feel and excellent value for couples or small groups. The right choice depends on your group size, comfort preferences, and the onboard atmosphere you want."
    },
    "recommendedNights": {
      "question": "How many nights do you recommend for the best Phuket sailing experience?",
      "answer": "We recommend 5 nights minimum. That's when you can comfortably reach quieter, more rewarding destinations like Koh Rok, Koh Ha, and the Butang Islands / Koh Lipe — places significantly less crowded than Phi Phi Islands and Phang Nga Bay."
    },
    "familyFriendly": {
      "question": "Are Phuket sailing charters suitable for families with children?",
      "answer": "Yes. We recommend stable catamarans, plan routes with calm protected swim stops, and pace the itinerary to suit your group. Our crew is experienced with family charters — and children typically say it's the best holiday they've ever had."
    },
    "romantic": {
      "question": "Is sailing in Phuket good for couples and romantic getaways?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Sunset sails, quiet overnight anchorages, and privacy in beautiful places make Phuket sailing one of the most romantic holiday experiences available. For honeymoons, anniversaries, or proposals, tell us early — we'll help plan something special."
    },
    "soloTravelers": {
      "question": "Can solo travelers book without renting a full private yacht?",
      "answer": "Yes. Cabin Cruises Phuket let you book by the cabin — a private space on a shared sailing cruise to the best islands, including Phi Phi, Koh Lanta, Koh Rok, and Racha Islands. The best-value way to experience multi-day Phuket sailing."
    },
    "whatsIncluded": {
      "question": "What's included in a crewed sailing charter in Phuket?",
      "answer": "Crewed charters typically include the vessel, professional crew, all meals, drinking water, fuel, safety equipment, and standard water activities. Extras like drinks, national park fees, and special setups are confirmed upfront — no hidden charges."
    },
    "bareboatLicense": {
      "question": "Do I need a sailing license for a bareboat charter in Phuket?",
      "answer": "Yes. Bareboat charters require a valid sailing license and demonstrated experience on a comparable vessel. If you're unsure whether you qualify, we're happy to advise — or recommend a crewed charter instead."
    },
    "chooseItinerary": {
      "question": "Can you help us choose the best Phuket sailing itinerary?",
      "answer": "Yes — it's one of the most valuable things we offer. Share your dates, number of nights, group size, and priorities (snorkeling, remote islands, beaches, adventure). We'll recommend a realistic route tailored to the season and designed to give your group the best possible experience."

Wide bow trampolines, a shaded cockpit dining area, and a stern swim platform mean your group is never crowded into one spot.

Twin hulls make them virtually impossible to capsize, their wide beam stays stable in choppy conditions, and children can move around the deck freely without the constant tipping of monohull sailing. This matters especially in Phuket, where overcrowded speedboat tours remain the common alternative — a private catamaran charter means controlled speeds, professional crew, proper safety equipment, and the freedom to adjust your route if conditions change."

      "questions": {
        "cost": {
          "q": "How much does a catamaran charter cost in Phuket?",
          "a": "Day charters start from €800. Overnight catamaran charters from €1,000/night. Premium air-conditioned catamarans from €2,500/night. All prices include crew, meals, fuel, and activities — no hidden fees."
        },
        "guests": {
          "q": "How many guests can a catamaran accommodate?",
          "a": "Our catamarans have 3–4 private cabins accommodating up to 8 overnight guests. For day charters, we can host up to 10–12 guests depending on the vessel. Every booking is private — you won't share with strangers."
        },
        "experience": {
          "q": "Do I need sailing experience to charter a catamaran?",
          "a": "Not at all. Every crewed catamaran charter includes a licensed skipper who handles all sailing. You're free to participate or simply relax. For experienced sailors, we also offer bareboat catamaran charters (valid license required)."
        },
        "children": {
          "q": "Are catamarans safe for children?",
          "a": "Yes — catamarans are the safest and most family-friendly charter option. The wide, stable platform means very little motion, safety railings and netting are standard, and life jackets are provided for all ages. Our crews are experienced with families and keep kids engaged with water activities."
        },
        "difference": {
          "q": "What's the difference between a catamaran and a monohull charter?",
          "a": "Catamarans are wider, more stable, and have more deck and cabin space. They don't heel (lean) under sail, making them far more comfortable for guests who aren't experienced sailors. They also have shallower drafts, allowing access to anchorages and lagoons monohulls can't reach."
        },
        "islands": {
          "q": "Which islands can I visit on a catamaran from Phuket?",
          "a": "Day trips: Phi Phi Islands, Racha Islands, Phang Nga Bay, Koh Hong. Multi-day: Koh Lanta, Koh Rok, Koh Ha, Similan Islands, Koh Lipe. Your itinerary is fully customizable."
        },
        "included": {
          "q": "What's included in the charter price?",
          "a": "Professional crew, all meals, drinking water, fuel, mooring, snorkeling gear, kayaks, paddleboards, safety equipment, and accident insurance. National park fees and alcoholic beverages are extra."
        },
        "bestTime": {
          "q": "When is the best time for a catamaran charter in Phuket?",
          "a": "November to April offers the best conditions — calm seas, clear skies, and steady sailing winds. December to March is peak season and books earliest. For quieter waters and lower prices, November and April are excellent shoulder months."
        },
        "advance": {
          "q": "How far in advance should I book?",
          "a": "Peak season (Dec–Mar): 2–4 weeks minimum. Christmas/New Year: 2–3 months recommended. For the best catamaran selection, booking early is always worthwhile — especially for multi-day charters."
        },
        "weather": {
          "q": "What if the weather is bad?",
          "a": "We reschedule for free, suggest alternative sheltered routes, or provide a full refund if we cancel for safety reasons. Our skippers monitor conditions constantly and will always prioritize your safety and comfort."
